# Use & Intent

This repository publishes **standards, schemas, and conformance mechanisms** intended to support
non-extractive, non-authoritative intelligence systems.

## Intent
The intent of this project is to:
- prevent surveillance-first architectures
- prevent actionable market signaling
- preserve human authority over decisions
- encourage minimal data retention by design
- support community stewardship and local capacity

## Non-Goals
This project does not seek to:
- provide operational playbooks
- optimize performance or cost at scale
- define domain-specific tuning or heuristics
- act as a regulatory or enforcement authority

## Implementations
Implementations may be open or closed source.
Compliance is determined by **behavior and guarantees**, not disclosure.

Implementations that intentionally violate the published guarantees may be technically compatible,
but are considered **out of alignment** with the project’s intent.
